# Unsupervised Machine Learning with Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to utilize unsupervised machine learning to gain an understanding of the cryptocurrency landscape, including which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped to create a classification system. A [Python script using Pandas in Jupyter Notebook](crypto_clustering.ipynb) was developed to preprocess a [cryptocurrency dataset](Resources/crypto_data.csv), apply principal component analysis to reduce the number of input features (dimensions) for the machine learning model, use K-means clustering to group the cryptocurrency data points, and create plots to visualize the groups.
